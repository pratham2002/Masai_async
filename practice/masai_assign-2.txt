Why do coding standards matter? What are some patterns you follow?
ans:
A coding standard makes sure that all the developers working on the project are following certain specified guidelines. The code can be easily understood and proper consistency is maintained.

Consistency has a positive impact on the quality of the program and one should maintain it while coding. Also, it should be taken care that coding rules are homogeneously followed across different levels of the system and they do not contradict each other. The finished program code should look like that it has been written by a single developer, in a single session.

How do you go about managing responsive websites?
ans:
When potential clients visit your website, they’re not looking for a pretty banner or great graphics; they’re looking for the content you have to offer.The backbone of responsive design is the ability to shift and format content depending on the size of the screen. In technical terms, this is known as “the media query.”

This terminology evolved from the term “media type,” which is a style sheet that determines how a piece of content is presented on different physical media, such as a screen, paper, or Braille device.

Media queries work similarly. However, instead of detecting the type of physical media, a media query detects the size of a screen. The website then decides to render a specific style sheet for that specific screen size.
