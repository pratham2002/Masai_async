What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
ans:
The fs.readFileSync() method is an inbuilt application programming interface of fs module which is used to read the file and return its content. 
In fs.readFile() method, we can read a file in a non-blocking asynchronous way, but in fs.readFileSync() method, we can read files in a synchronous way, i.e. we are telling node.js to block other parallel process and do the current file reading process. That is, when the fs.readFileSync() method is called the original node program stops executing, and node waits for the fs.readFileSync() function to get executed, after getting the result of the method the remaining node program is executed.
 
What does process in node.js mean?

JavaScript is basically one standard defining programming language; it can run any browser with a default browser running environment.

Write three different ways to reverse a string in Javascript? a. using inbuilt method, b. iteratively, c. recursively

ans:
a)
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

b)
function reverseString(str){
	let temp=""
	for(var i = str.length-1;i>=0;i--){
		temp+=str[i]
}
return temp
}

c)
function reverseString(str) {
  if (str === "")
    return "";
  else
    return reverseString(str.substr(1)) + str.charAt(0);
}


What is shallow equal?
ans:
Shallow compare does check for equality. When comparing scalar values (numbers, strings) it compares their values. When comparing objects, it does not compare their attributes - only their references are compared (e.g. "do they point to same object?").
